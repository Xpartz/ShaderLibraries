# ShaderLibraries

This library of functions for the shader graph in Unity. I use them to create effects and want to share them with you. Each function will have a detailed description and instructions for use. Good luck!

# Scale from the center

The function has the ability to disable tiling at the shader level through the saturate function.


# Gradient

You can use this function with different coordinates in space. In my example, I used a simple UV coordinate from one axis. However, you can create a gradient using coordinates from object space or world space. Take one axis from the coordinates and create a gradient.
